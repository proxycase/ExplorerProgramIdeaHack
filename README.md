# ExplorerProgramIdeaHack
Winning Idea Hack for the Explorer Program

Team: Hugh Sato, Annie Darmofal, John Ehlinger, Stephanie Castillo

So there are a couple of things happening in here.

1. The Explorer Program PDF and PPTX are both the same copy of the final presentation presented on October 23, 2015 to the Explorer Program, with 4 total teams presenting ideas from the 24 hour hackathon.
2. The Printable Postcards are one of the major keypoints that won us the hackathon, and physical prints of them were handed out during the presentation.
3. The Master Notes are my notes from the original presenatation from the Explorer Program, plus additions by the team and their presentation keypoints. Most of those notes are inserted in the PPTX notes however.
4. The Slide Design Pieces are how certain slides in the PPTX were created, and the original source (AI FILE) is also included.
